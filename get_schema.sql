-- Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to get your full schema
-- Copy the results and share them so I can create a detailed migration plan

-- 1. Get all table structures
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

-- 2. Get all foreign key relationships
SELECT
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
    AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
ORDER BY tc.table_name;

-- 3. Get primary keys
SELECT
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY'
    AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY tc.table_name;

-- 4. Quick check: Do any tables already have club_id or season_id?
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND (column_name LIKE '%club%' OR column_name LIKE '%season%')
ORDER BY table_name;
